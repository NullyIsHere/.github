  We're UnifierHQ</h1>
<p align=center>We're a team of hobbyists working on a better way to unite communities on Discord and more.<br>
UnifierHQ is not an "organization", just a name we use to identify ourselves</p>

## Our story (and mission)
In the past, connecting different communities online on Discord wasn't as easy. This was a problem for us, as we wanted to unite communities
that we were good friends with, so everyone could hang out more easily. There was just no bot cut out for that, the ones that already existed
didn't really meet our needs as well as we wanted it to.

So we decided to take it into our own hand ourselves. If no bot can fulfill our needs, we'll make one ourselves. And thus, Unifier was born.

Ever since then, we've diversified our mission from just connecting Discord servers to bringing communities of any size together, no matter 
the platform. We want to build a **free, safe, and open** chatting space for everyone, no matter the community or platform.

## The Unifier project
We're the creators of Unifier, an open source, versatile, and lightning-fast cross-server and cross-platform bridge bot.

### [Unifier](https://github.com/UnifierHQ/unifier)
Our flagship bot that unites Discord communities into one. It has multi-server support, so you can link even more communities together.
Multi-platform support is enabled using platform support plugins.

### [Unifier Micro](https://github.com/UnifierHQ/unifier-micro)
A memory-efficient light version of Unifier, containing only the core features. Built for small communities that only use Discord.

## Plugins
We've created Plugins for Unifier ourselves, which you can easily install to your own instance.

### [Unifier for Revolt](https://github.com/UnifierHQ/unifier-revolt)
Unifier Revolt Support is a plugin for Unifier that allows you to connect Revolt communities. You can connect your Discord communties with 
Revolt ones, or link Revolt communities together.
  
### [Unifier for Guilded](https://github.com/UnifierHQ/unifier-guilded)
Unifier Guilded Support is a plugin for Unifier that allows you to connect Guilded communities. It's like Unifier for Revolt, but for Guilded.

### [RaidGuard](https://github.com/UnifierHQ/unifier-raidguard)
RaidGuard is a plugin which protects your communities from raiders by scanning messages for content commonly found in raids. All scanning is 
done locally on your machine.

## Side projects
Projects we work on that are either experimental or not as active.

### Discord-Nerimity playground
We're experimenting with [Nerimity](https://nerimity.com/) API to see how we can use it with Discord and others in the future. Not open source 
yet, but soon (once we actually finish it, that is).
