<p align=center>We're a team of hobbyists working on a better way to unite communities on Discord and more.</p>

## Projects
We have open source projects made to connect you and your communities!

### [Unifier](https://github.com/UnifierHQ/unifier)
Our flagship bot that unites Discord communities into one. It has multi-server support, so you can link even more communities together.
Multi-platform support is enabled using platform support plugins.

### [Unifier Micro](https://github.com/UnifierHQ/unifier-micro)
A memory-efficient light version of Unifier, containing only the core features. Built for small communities that only use Discord.

### [Unifier for Revolt](https://github.com/UnifierHQ/unifier-revolt)
Unifier for Revolt is a plugin for Unifier that allows you to connect Revolt communities. You can connect your Discord communties with 
Revolt ones, or link Revolt communities together.
  
### [Unifier for Guilded](https://github.com/UnifierHQ/unifier-guilded)
Unifier for Guilded is a plugin for Unifier that allows you to connect Guilded communities. It's like Unifier for Revolt, but for Guilded.

## Side projects
Projects we work on that are either experimental or not as active.

### Discord-Nerimity playground
We're experimenting with [Nerimity](https://nerimity.com/) API to see how we can use it with Discord and others in the future.
